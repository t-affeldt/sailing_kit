# Sailing Kit
with support for [Climate API](https://github.com/t-affeldt/climate_api)

This is a fork of [Termos' sailing kit](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=23520) mod.
I have modified it to use Climate API's wind system if available.
The old included wind system remains in the mod as a fallback if Climate API is missing.
